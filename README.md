Thi is my first JavaScript project that I ppsted on GutHub but with the help of chatGPT, one thing is sure... JS is super dificult unlike HTML and CSS, that I completed in under a month, JS will gonna take me at least a year, and the path to App Developement is deinitely not going to be easy. but one thing is sure, if this shit is THIS defficult for me, then for others it's sure just a nightmare...
